- How were the spike detections done when 

- lines 62-67, why grab the angle subthreshold for both 40 and 140 for all traces

- line 79-80, are they just storing the subthreshold Vm with corresponding time

- line 94, why subtracting 15, shouldnt it be 10? Previous line was truncating 10 

- lines 92-97, is it remaking the spike raster?
